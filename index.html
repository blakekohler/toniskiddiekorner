                    <br>
                    <p>The Preschool Place, formerly known as Kiddie Korner Preschool and Toni’s Preschool Place, was founded in September of 2013 when Toni decided to pursue her dream of starting a preschool in her basement. Although she started alone with
                        just a couple of children, her preschool philosophy and business quickly started to grow. In September of 2015, Toni hired Megan Zeitner and it was the best decision she could have made for her business! Megan’s natural talent,
                        love of teaching young children, and her belief in play-based learning was the perfect compliment to Toni’s preschool curriculum and philosophy. Together, Toni and Megan have decided to re-brand into The Preschool Place. They believe
                        deeply in the power of learning through play-based experiences and they want to give this gift to as many children as they can, which is why they are always striving to add more locations.

                    <h2>Meet Toni</h2>
                    <p>I began teaching out of my home in September of 2013. I graduated from Utah State University with a dual bachelor’s degree in Elementary Education and Early Childhood Development. I also have an endorsement in teaching English as a
                        second language. After graduating, I got a job teaching Kindergarten in Alpine School District and taught for three years. I also taught English online to children in China. I love young children and the magic that learning can
                        bring into their lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a former kindergarten teacher, I have seen the curriculum become increasingly demanding. The bar has been raised and benchmarks have been heightened. While I know what is expected of children at the kindergarten level, I also know
                        that research has shown that children who participate in play and discovery-based learning in their early childhood are more successful in later life. I want to prepare your child to meet and exceed kindergarten expectations according
                        to what is developmentally appropriate to them. I believe that children learn best through play and real-life experiences. I take a constructivist approach and use play to motivate and plan curriculum and learning.</p>
                    <p>I know that this is a critical time in your child’s life. That is why I teach to the whole child, to cover all of the areas of their unique development.
                    </p>
                    <p> I truly believe that I have a once in a lifetime opportunity to create a love for learning in children’s hearts. I want to inspire and instill in your child a deep love for imagining, creating, playing, and learning. They will develop
                        a strong learning foundation to last them for the rest of their lives!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Meet Megan</h2>
                    <p>From a young age I always knew I wanted to teach. As I got older my passion for teaching grew, and in 2015 I graduated from BYU-Idaho with my degree in Elementary Education. While going to school I spent 2 years working as a paraprofessional
                        and got to spend lots of time observing and teaching in special needs classrooms. I have also been in 1st, 2nd, and 4th grade classrooms, and have loved the unique challenges that have accompanied each grade level. I have taught
                        English as a Second language for the last 4 years, and I have absolutely loved the last 4 years teaching preschool with Toni. I live in Eagle Mountain with my husband and two kids (ages 2 and 4).
                    </p>
                    <p>While I was going to school I never anticipated ending up in a preschool classroom, but it has truly been the best surprise. As both an educator and mother of young children myself, I have gained such an appreciation for the importance
                        of early education. The way we teach, speak to, and interact with children during their early years makes a profound impact on them throughout their lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>I believe so strongly that every child has the capacity to learn and succeed, but every child is so different. It has been so rewarding to help create a curriculum and program that takes every student where they are, and helps them
                        succeed in ways that are unique and personal to the child individually. Not only do I believe that play-based, hands on learning is what’s best for young children cognitively, it also makes learning so much more fun! I am so excited
                        to learn, play, and have fun with your students this year!
                    </p>

                                                            language development, encourages ‘scientific thinking’ and problem solving, and builds nerve connections in the brain. Because the items in our sensory table are switched out often, our students
                                                            are always actively exploring and engaging.

                                                            hoops, etc. for the children to play with.

                                    Book bags will be sent home each week to give your child some exciting new choices when reading each night. Homework will be provided, but is not required. With a curriculum based around play, your child will learn

                                <p>Consider this preschool class to be an intermediate class, or in-between the Little Learners Class and the Kinder-Prep class. It will follow the same curriculum as the kinder-prep class, but at a slower rate, since it is
                                    only two days per week. We have combined the ages to give siblings the opportunity to attend preschool together, and to also give more options for pricing and schedule. If your child will have just turned three years
                                    old by the time preschool starts, we strongly suggest that you enroll them in the little Learners Class. If your child is on the older side of three (will be turning four shortly after the school year begins, this class
                                    would be a better fit for them.) We will split the class into groups during learning time to give the best support for your child.

                                recommend Toni’s to anyone searching for a great preschool!”</p>

                                with all the different activities they do to help them learn. My son is more than ready for kindergarten because of his preschool experience.”

                                “We have been going to Toni's preschool since she opened I believe it's been about 6 years and we would not take our kids anywhere else! They know exactly what your child needs to be ready for kindergarten. My oldest missed the kindergarten deadline by
                                a few weeks and she was so ready to go to kindergarten. By the time she left Toni's preschool and went into kindergarten she was testing in reading at a 2nd grade reading level. They sent her home with harder reading to
                                help push her and it helped her so much to be able to go to kindergarten after. I love that about them! I also love that they try to teach the kids healthy eating habits. They cook things and it's always healthy recipes.
                                They encourage bringing other things besides sugar for bdays and valentine's, etc. I love that they mix play and learning. My kids always come home excited with all the things they did! They do field trips frequently and
                                it's always fun things! I've had 3 kids go through her school and will have this year without a preschooler and I'm so sad!!! Only because this preschool has been the most positive thing for my girls! I hands down would
                                recommend them over and over!! One of the best decisions I've made! </p>

                                “The Preschool Place is the absolute best preschool. We've been sending our kids there for 5 years, and all 3 of our daughters have absolutely loved it. The teachers are wonderful and my kids have been so prepared for kindergarten. As a mom who believes
                                that little ones should be playing to learn, and who was hesitant to send her kids to preschool because I didn't want to burn them out, I'm so grateful to have found such a wonderful preschool. The Preschool Place has found
                                the perfect balance between play and learning, and the confidence my girls have gained there is the best school foundation I could have asked for." </p>
