                    <br>
                    <p>The Preschool Place, formerly known as Kiddie Korner Preschool and Toni’s Preschool Place, was founded in September of 2013 when Toni decided to pursue her dream of starting a preschool in her basement. Although she started alone with
                        just a couple of children, her preschool philosophy and business quickly started to grow. In September of 2015, Toni hired Megan Zeitner and it was the best decision she could have made for her business! Megan’s natural talent,
                        love of teaching young children, and her belief in play-based learning was the perfect compliment to Toni’s preschool curriculum and philosophy. Together, Toni and Megan have decided to re-brand into The Preschool Place. They believe
                        deeply in the power of learning through play-based experiences and they want to give this gift to as many children as they can, which is why they are always striving to add more locations.

                    <h2>Meet Toni</h2>
                    <p>I began teaching out of my home in September of 2013. I graduated from Utah State University with a dual bachelor’s degree in Elementary Education and Early Childhood Development. I also have an endorsement in teaching English as a
                        second language. After graduating, I got a job teaching Kindergarten in Alpine School District and taught for three years. I also taught English online to children in China. I love young children and the magic that learning can
                        bring into their lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a former kindergarten teacher, I have seen the curriculum become increasingly demanding. The bar has been raised and benchmarks have been heightened. While I know what is expected of children at the kindergarten level, I also know
                        that research has shown that children who participate in play and discovery-based learning in their early childhood are more successful in later life. I want to prepare your child to meet and exceed kindergarten expectations according
                        to what is developmentally appropriate to them. I believe that children learn best through play and real-life experiences. I take a constructivist approach and use play to motivate and plan curriculum and learning.</p>
                    <p>I know that this is a critical time in your child’s life. That is why I teach to the whole child, to cover all of the areas of their unique development.
                    </p>
                    <p> I truly believe that I have a once in a lifetime opportunity to create a love for learning in children’s hearts. I want to inspire and instill in your child a deep love for imagining, creating, playing, and learning. They will develop
                        a strong learning foundation to last them for the rest of their lives!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Meet Megan</h2>
                    <p>From a young age I always knew I wanted to teach. As I got older my passion for teaching grew, and in 2015 I graduated from BYU-Idaho with my degree in Elementary Education. While going to school I spent 2 years working as a paraprofessional
                        and got to spend lots of time observing and teaching in special needs classrooms. I have also been in 1st, 2nd, and 4th grade classrooms, and have loved the unique challenges that have accompanied each grade level. I have taught
                        English as a Second language for the last 4 years, and I have absolutely loved the last 4 years teaching preschool with Toni. I live in Eagle Mountain with my husband and two kids (ages 2 and 4).
                    </p>
                    <p>While I was going to school I never anticipated ending up in a preschool classroom, but it has truly been the best surprise. As both an educator and mother of young children myself, I have gained such an appreciation for the importance
                        of early education. The way we teach, speak to, and interact with children during their early years makes a profound impact on them throughout their lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>I believe so strongly that every child has the capacity to learn and succeed, but every child is so different. It has been so rewarding to help create a curriculum and program that takes every student where they are, and helps them
                        succeed in ways that are unique and personal to the child individually. Not only do I believe that play-based, hands on learning is what’s best for young children cognitively, it also makes learning so much more fun! I am so excited
                        to learn, play, and have fun with your students this year!

                    <p>
                        I’ve known since elementary school that I wanted to be a teacher. With that in mind, I attended Southern Utah University on a scholarship and started my degree in Elementary Education. It was during my sophomore year that I began to take a few child development classes and realized that THIS was my passion! I was fascinated with how children develop and learn in their early years of life, and I immediately began plotting how I could someday run my own preschool. I quickly changed my major and was able to graduate with a Bachelor’s Degree in Early Childhood Development. Classes and internships allowed me to spend many hours at the on-campus preschool and daycare and I was able to have hands-on experiences with many different children, lesson planning practice, and management skills. I was also working as an aide in a 2nd grade classroom at a local elementary school during my last year of college which expanded my learning of classroom management even more. After graduating, I worked as a Paraprofessional for 3 years in both 2nd grade and kindergarten classrooms, working mainly with children who had been diagnosed with autism or learning disabilities. I was also able to spend 4 years teaching English online to foreign students and it was so rewarding to learn about other cultures while also teaching about my own! 
                    </p> <p>
                        Preschool is typically a child’s first exposure to education and it’s my goal to make that learning experience a positive one. Children best enjoy learning when it's fun and engaging, and I love dancing, singing and laughing with my students! I’m also very compassionate and I truly view each student as one of my own children. I absolutely LOVE being a teacher! There is no greater feeling in the world than watching a child develop new skills and seeing the joy on their faces when they complete something that was once difficult. I am so grateful to be a part of The Preschool Place team!  I have been with them since 2020 and it has been the best experience! I can’t wait to get to know your child and to watch them grow, learn and develop a love for school!

                    <p>In high school, while working a summer job as a swim teacher, I discovered that I had a passion for teaching and helping students learn. I also found it very fulfilling to watch them have that “light bulb moment” when they finally understood a concept or accomplished something they had struggled with. After high school, I attended Brigham Young University and earned a bachelor's degree in Early Childhood Education, with a minor in Teaching English Language Learners. </p>
                    <p>
                    While in college, I volunteered in a low income Elementary classroom and also began working as a paraprofessional in the special education department at Ascent Academy. I had the opportunity to do part of my student teaching at the BYU preschool and in a local Kindergarten classroom. While student teaching, I gained an appreciation for the importance of play-based learning. I know that it is an essential part of a young child’s development and future success in the classroom.</p>
                    <p>
                    After graduating in 2019, I spent four years teaching First Grade at both Brookhaven and Silver Lake Elementary schools before having my first child. While I loved teaching at each of these schools, I have always wanted to teach preschool from my own home and be able to stay at home with my daughter. I am very excited for this opportunity to begin teaching preschool and to continue doing something I love. I love being an educator and watching children discover the world around them. I can’t wait to help your students learn and grow!</p>

                    <h2>Meet Katie</h2>
                   <p>Hello! I’m Katie and I will be heading the Saratoga Springs location for The Preschool Place! 
                </p>
                   <p>My husband and I spent 16 years moving back and forth from California to Arizona before relocation to Saratoga Springs in 2021. We have four kids that keep us on our toes. I love reading, crocheting, hiking, camping, and crafting.</p>
                   <p>I started working at The Preschool Place in 2022 and knew within the first month of working that I wanted to open my own location with this amazing preschool! I have worked in K-5 elementary schools in California(2014-2016), Arizona(2018), and have over a decade of experience working with neurodivergent children and teens, as well as children who have anxiety and are on the spectrum. In 2022 I started working in Alpine School District as an Intervention Aide for grades First through Fourth before finding The Preschool Place. Being a preschool teacher is by far the best job I’ve ever had and the most fun!
                </p>
                   <p>I strongly believe that every child is unique, especially in how they learn! Having two of my own children with ADHD and anxiety I know how important it is to find how each child learns so that they can be confident in themselves and succeed! One of the most rewarding things for me as a teacher is when my students have that “Aha!” moment and their eyes light up when they learn something new. My goal for all of my students is to help them feel loved and safe so that they can be comfortable being themselves and expressing themselves. In doing so, we can help them cultivate a love for learning that they will carry with them throughout their academic years. I am so excited to get to know your kids and be a part of the magic that we create at The Preschool Place to help them fall in love with learning!

                                                            multiple art mediums without the added pressure of having to produce a modeled product.

                                                            language development, encourages ‘scientific thinking’ and problem solving, and builds nerve connections in the brain. Because the items in our sensory table are switched out often, our students
                                                            are always actively exploring and engaging.

                                <p>Snack time is the best time to teach manners and social skills! Your child will be offered a snack every day that they come to school. Snack will include a small food item and a drink (juice, milk, water). We like to offer
                                    healthy snacks as a way of introducing new foods and promoting healthy habits. With the exception of cooking experiences, we try to stay away from high-sugar snacks. Most snacks will be incorporated into the theme and
                                    will be mix-matched to make snack time fun and exciting.

                                    children to read until they are ready. We follow the Fountas & Pinnell’s phonics program. This program introduces letters, literacy, and phonics. We will teach beginning reading if your child is interested and ready.
                                    Book bags will be sent home each week to give your child some exciting new choices when reading each night. Homework will be provided, but is not required. With a curriculum based around play, your child will learn

                                <p>Consider this preschool class to be an intermediate class, or in-between the Little Learners Class and the Kinder-Prep class. It will follow the same curriculum as the kinder-prep class, but at a slower rate, since it is
                                    only two days per week. We have combined the ages to give siblings the opportunity to attend preschool together, and to also give more options for pricing and schedule. If your child will have just turned three years
                                    old by the time preschool starts, we strongly suggest that you enroll them in the little Learners Class. If your child is on the older side of three (will be turning four shortly after the school year begins, this class
                                    would be a better fit for them.) We will split the class into groups during learning time to give the best support for your child.

                                help push her and it helped her so much to be able to go to kindergarten after. I love that about them! I also love that they try to teach the kids healthy eating habits. They cook things and it's always healthy recipes.
                                They encourage bringing other things besides sugar for bdays and valentine's, etc. I love that they mix play and learning. My kids always come home excited with all the things they did! They do field trips frequently and
                                it's always fun things! I've had 3 kids go through her school and will have this year without a preschooler and I'm so sad!!! Only because this preschool has been the most positive thing for my girls! I hands down would
                                recommend them over and over!! One of the best decisions I've made! </p>

                                “The Preschool Place is the absolute best preschool. We've been sending our kids there for 5 years, and all 3 of our daughters have absolutely loved it. The teachers are wonderful and my kids have been so prepared for kindergarten. As a mom who believes
                                that little ones should be playing to learn, and who was hesitant to send her kids to preschool because I didn't want to burn them out, I'm so grateful to have found such a wonderful preschool. The Preschool Place has found
                                the perfect balance between play and learning, and the confidence my girls have gained there is the best school foundation I could have asked for." </p>
